A devoted **Game of Thrones** fan despite the ending. I like **the sea** and **the rain**, but not at the same time. Now I have entered the jungles of **coding**, but fortunately I`m not alone here and I have **_BeCode_**.

> **3 surprising skills:**

- **_Good memory:_** anything you say can be used against you=)
- **_I crochet_**. Yes, in 2022 I crochet and I'm under 60=)
